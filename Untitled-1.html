                <h2>"That Blessed Hope"</h2> 
                <p>
                    The apostle Paul mentioned in his letter to Titus a certain hope that we as Christians are to have via, Expecting the grand object of our hope, eternal life. This what the gospel teaches us to expect, and what the grace of God prepares the human heart for. This is called my brothers and sisters a Blessed! HOPE! For sure they that have it are happy in the sure prospect of that glory that shall be revealed. Some think that that the BLESSED hope and the GLORIOUS appearing mean the same thing; but I don't think so. The blessed hope refers simply to eternal glorification in general; the GLORIOUS APPEARING to the resurrection of the body. REMEMBERING what Paul said in {Phil. 3: 21} for when Christ appears He will change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body...NOW THAT'S Something TO LOOK FORWARD to my brothers and my sisters in Christ, Amen? Remember that statement that our Lord made in Jn. 11:25 "I AM THE RESURRECTION and the LIFE... 
                </p>
                <div class="nextp">
                    <p>No other person in the life or the life to come can make that statement! And to back it up, He rose victoriously from the grave according to the scriptures. The Pharisees believed that the resurrection was just for the godly; But Jesus rectified that in John 5:28,29. The resurrection of LIFE and the resurrection of DAMNATION. Paul in his discourse with Felix in Acts 24:15 mentions " | have HOPE in God, they also accept, that there WILL BE a resurrection of the dead, BOTH of the JUST and the UNJUST. This exactly what the prophet Daniel referred to in the book of Daniel 12; 2 (many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, Some to everlasting LIFE, Some to everlasting CONTEMPT!) So it is VERY CLEAR that the saints will have resurrected enteral bodies unto life and the unsaved or nonbelievers will also have bodies that will suffer torment for eternity and eternity is never ending existence, in fact. ETERNITY IS NOT JUST EXTENDED TIME, BUT RATHER, IT IS EXISTENCE ABOVE AND APART FROM TIME. This is a very SERIOUS state to be in Truth is, it would be better not to have been born then to be separated from your creator. We as humans chose our destiny for choosing to except and believe in the Lord's plan of salvation and the price that was paid for our redemption or call Him a liar by not believing. We as the children of God have this hope, for as the scripture said, in 1 Cor. 15:19 " If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men pitiful. But now {remember BUT always mean the flip side] Christ is risen from the dead and has become the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep. (deceased) Do have a part in the blessed Hope? Without Jesus there is no hope. THINK ON THESE THINGS...</p>

                <h2>“WHY THE BIBLE IS THE ONLY WORD OF GOD?”</h2> 
                <p>The Bible is the only word that proves itself. You probably say wow minister Kithcart that's a bold statement. And you're right it is! Tell you what, if you can show the church of Jesus Christ another book that proves itself like the sixty-six books in the bible am all ears. But you cannot. For there is not another religious book on this planet that can name a person before they are born. Such as: 
                    Ishmael (Ge. 16:11)
                     Issac (Ge. 17:19) 
                    Solomon (1Chron. 22:9) 
                    Josiah (kings 13:2) 350 yrs before he was born. 
                    Cyrus (Isa. 44:8) 150 before he was born.
                     John the baptist (Luke 1:13) and 
                    Jesus the Son of God (Matt 1:21)
                    You can't overlook all of the prophecies and the Psalms concerning the Christ. What another book could do that? It's like the Lord God asking the children of Israel, "Is there a God besides me? yea there is no God; I don't know any. (Isa.44:8)...
