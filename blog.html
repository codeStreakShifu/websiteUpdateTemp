                <h2>"That Blessed Hope"</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="short-text">
                        The apostle Paul mentioned in his letter to Titus a certain hope that we as Christians are to
                        have via, Expecting the grand object of our hope, eternal life. This what the gospel teaches us
                        to expect, and what the grace of God prepares the human heart for. This is called my brothers
                        and sisters a Blessed! HOPE! For sure they that have it are happy in the sure prospect of that
                        glory that shall be revealed. Some think that that the BLESSED hope and the GLORIOUS appearing
                        mean the same thing; but I don't think so. The blessed hope refers simply to eternal
                        glorification in general; the GLORIOUS APPEARING to the resurrection of the body. REMEMBERING
                        what Paul said in {Phil. 3: 21} for when Christ appears He will change our vile body that it may
                        be fashioned like unto His glorious body... NOW THAT'S Something TO LOOK FORWARD to my brothers
                        and my sisters in Christ, Amen? Remember that statement that our Lord made in Jn. 11:25 "I AM
                        THE RESURRECTION and the LIFE...

                        THE RESURRECTION and the LIFE... No other person in the life or the life to come can make that
                        statement! And to back it up, He rose victoriously from the grave according to the scriptures.
                        The Pharisees believed that the resurrection was just for the godly; But Jesus rectified that in
                        John 5:28,29. The resurrection of LIFE and the resurrection of DAMNATION. Paul in his discourse
                        with Felix in Acts 24:15 mentions " | have HOPE in God, they also accept, that there WILL BE a
                        resurrection of the dead, BOTH of the JUST and the UNJUST. This exactly what the prophet Daniel
                        referred to in the book of Daniel 12; 2 (many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall
                        awake, Some to everlasting LIFE, Some to everlasting CONTEMPT!) So it is VERY CLEAR that the
                        saints will have resurrected enteral bodies unto life and the unsaved or nonbelievers will also
                        have bodies that will suffer torment for eternity and eternity is never ending existence, in
                        fact. ETERNITY IS NOT JUST EXTENDED TIME, BUT RATHER, IT IS EXISTENCE ABOVE AND APART FROM TIME.
                        This is a very SERIOUS state to be in Truth is, it would be better not to have been born then to
                        be separated from your creator. We as humans chose our destiny for choosing to except and
                        believe in the Lord's plan of salvation and the price that was paid for our redemption or call
                        Him a liar by not believing. We as the children of God have this hope, for as the scripture
                        said, in 1 Cor. 15:19 " If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men pitiful.
                        But now {remember BUT always mean the flip side] Christ is risen from the dead and has become
                        the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep. (deceased) Do have a part in the blessed Hope?
                        Without Jesus there is no hope. THINK ON THESE THINGS...

                <h2>“WHY THE BIBLE IS THE ONLY WORD OF GOD?”</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="short-text">
                        The Bible is the only word that proves itself. You probably say wow minister Kithcart that's a
                        bold statement. And you're right it is! Tell you what, if you can show the church of Jesus
                        Christ another book that proves itself like the sixty-six books in the bible am all ears. But
                        you cannot. For there is not another religious book on this planet that can name a person before
                        they are born. Such as:
                        Ishmael (Ge. 16:11)
                        Issac (Ge. 17:19)
                        Solomon (1Chron. 22:9)
                        Josiah (kings 13:2) 350 yrs before he was born.
                        Cyrus (Isa. 44:8) 150 before he was born.
                        John the baptist (Luke 1:13) and
                        Jesus the Son of God (Matt 1:21)
                        You can't overlook all of the prophecies and the Psalms concerning the Christ. What another book
                        could do that? It's like the Lord God asking the children of Israel, "Is there a God besides me?
                        yea there is no God; I don't know any. (Isa.44:8)...

                        No other book could give some 300 distinct prophecies concerning Christ's first Coming and ALL
                        fulfilled. That's why am so adamant about this book the bible as the ONLY True Word of God.
                        EVERYTHING else is by Satan's design! Remember Cyrus was a king and emperor by God's design and
                        Isaiah prophesied 600 years before the birth of Christ. If one cannot see and understand these
                        Truths they are in serious spiritual trouble. THINK ABOUT....

                    <span class="short-text">
                        There are many benefits of being a child of God that the
                        world can not conceive, simply because of our new nature
                        which we receive as new creations in Christ 2Cor.5:17. Does
                        that mean that everyone is a child of God? The answer is NO
                        we are all God's creation, but not His children. You say
                        brother Kithcart, that is quite a statement. Well it is, yet the
                        scriptures tells us plainly in Romans 8:9b Now if anyone does
                        not have the Spirit of Christ, he {or she} is NOT His. This is
                        TRUE of every religion on this earth! Not that we have a
                        religion, but rather a relationship with the Father through His
                        Son by the Spirit of Truth. For the scripture tells us that; "Nor
                        is there salvation in any other, for there is NO other name
                        under heaven given among men by which we must be
                        saved." Acts 4:12. For in Him we live, and move and have our

                        being; For we are also His OFFSPRING, Acts:17:28,29. The
                        great news as children, we have so many undeserved
                        benefits because of His AMAZING GRACE. These benefits
                        include being heirs of God and joint heirs with His Son,
                        according to the scriptures. Ro.8:17; And something that we
                        as Children must not overlook, " If indeed we suffer with Him,
                        that we may also be glorified together". The apostle Peter
                        reminds of this truth concerning true believers, 1 Pe.1:21. I
                        will list some of the many realities as Christians that we
                        should be thankful for:

                        <br><br>
                        1. His precious blood that redeems us<br>
                        2. Our redemption<br>
                        3. Our liberty<br>
                        4. His mercy<br>
                        5. His grace<br>
                        6. His forgiveness<br>
                        7. His faithfulness<br>
                        8. His love<br>
                        9. His loving kindness<br>
                        10. For the gift of the Holy Spirit<br>
                        11. His peace<br>
                        12. His understanding<br>
                        13. His knowledge<br>

                        person such as the apostle Paul in whom the words of
                        the Lord to Ananias concerning Saul at that time,
                        that ..." he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name
                        before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel." Now
                        the Word of God reveals that these mysteries were hid
                        in the mine of God and were only revealed to the
                        apostle Paul. These are the mysteries that were
                        revealed to the body of Christ by Spirit of the Lord to
                        ONLY Paul : <br> <br>
                        1. Mystery of the Gospel : Ephesians 6:19,20 ; Romans
                        16:25,26. <br>
                        2. Mystery of Christ : Ephesians 3:4-5 ; Colossians
                        1:26,27. <br>
                        3. Mystery of Godliness: 1 Timothy 3:16. <br>
                        4. Mystery of Faith : 1 Timothy 3:9. <br>
                        5. Mystery of Israel's Blindness : Romans 11:25-32. <br>
                        6. Mystery of the Rapture : 1 Thes. 4:13-18; 1 Cor.15:
                        50-54. <br>
                        7. Mystery of God's Plan for the Gentiles: Eph.3:1-13;
                        Ro11:11-24. <br> <br>
                        The mysteries revealed to Paul were UNIQUE to him.
                        While the other apostles wrote about related Truths
                        and instructions, they didn't receive the exact same
                        revelations. The apostle Paul's writings provide a
                        distinct perspective on these Mysteries. Maybe
                        because Paul and Barnabas were given the right hand
                        of fellowship that they should go to the Gentiles and
                        Peter, James and John to the circumcised. Gal.2:7-9.
                        Although the apostle Paul greatly loved his own
                        people, for he visited synagogues 9 TIMES in the book
                        of Acts. He preached to Jews and Greeks, proclaiming
                        the gospel of Jesus Christ. Notable visits include
                        Antioch, Corinth and Ephesus. Indeed initially Paul
                        preached to Jews at Corith, but they opposed him.
                        Then he turned to the Gentiles and established a
                        church in Corinth. Acts 18:5-17.

                        truth that am about to share with the body and
                        members of Christ is this FACT and that is as
                        Christians, well first let me as a minister of Christ, ask
                        you this question, via have you ever heard a Christian
                        or Pastor or teacher say "am just a sinner saved by
                        grace" sounds a bit of humility, yet not in the site of
                        the ONE who reconciled us back to God. Sure no doubt
                        we are tempted to sin (Ja.1:14) some times over taken
                        by sin (Gal.6:1) for sure because of fallen our fallen
                        nature that we inherited from our fore parents Adam
                        and Eve, nevertheless once we are born of the Spirit
                        and placed in the body of Christ we are NEVER CALLED
                        SINNERS AGAIN! NEVER, again I say NEVER. This what
                        we are called : <br>

                        of the Highest, <br>
                        of the living God, NEVER SINNERS, always in the past
                        sense WERE we referred to, before we became the
                        offspring of God, Acts 17:28,29. Remember sinners
                        can not inherit he kingdom of God. In whom we once
                        WERE. Think about it and be sure to fact check the
                        scriptures. Be like the Berens who searched the
                        scriptures daily to see whether whose things that Paul
                        taught were so. Acts 17:11. <br><br>

                <p>
                    <span class="short-text">
                        It was the promise land that the Lord had promised to the children of
                        Israel for them to take and conquer with His help. And this is how it is told in the scriptures
                        in the old covenant : Of course most students of the bible have heard of this story and so was I
                        until I heard a teacher of the bible named Les Feldick arrested my attention to what was really
                        the Lord's plan to conquer Israel's enemy and it WAS'T the twelve spies! Take notice or recall
                        the ten plagues that Israel witness by the power of the Lord. These plagues demonstrated God's
                        power over Pharaoh and the Egyptian gods,ultimately leading to the Israelite's' freedom from
                        slavery. These are the 10 plagues of the book of Exodus:

                    </span>
                    <span class="full-text" style="display: none;">
                        1. Water turned into blood (Ex. 7:14-24),<br>
                        2. Frogs (7:25-8:15),<br>
                        3. Lice or gnats (8:16-32),<br>
                        4. Flies (8:20-32),<br>
                        5. Disease on livestock (9:1-7),<br>
                        6. Boils (9:8-12),<br>
                        7. Hail (9:13-35),<br>
                        8. Locusts (10:1-20),<br>
                        9. Darkness (10:21-29),<br>
                        10. Death of the firstborn and the firstborn of cattle (11-12).<br><br>

                        If that wasn’t enough the Lord opened the Red Sea so that they could escape from the approaching
                        of Pharaoh's army.<br>
                        There were so many signs and miracles that followed, but the Israelites had one MAJOR problem
                        which was people of whom there was NO FAITH (Deu. 32:20).<br>
                        This is what the Lord said of them.<br>
                        We as Christians should take note of their lack of faith and trust in God after the Lord brought
                        us through so much.<br>
                        Can I get a witness?<br><br>

                        Romans 15:4 "For whatever things written before were written for our learning, that we through
                        patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope."<br>
                        The apostle Paul also mentioned to the Corinthians the things that happened with Israel:<br>
                        NOW ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED TO THEM AS EXAMPLES AND THEY WERE WRITTEN FOR OUR ADMONITION... (1
                        Cor. 10:11).<br><br>

                        Ok, back to the subject at hand — KADESH BARNEA.<br>
                        The Lord promised to send an Angel before them to prepare them for the land of their enemies,
                        who they were and how He would destroy them.<br>
                        And that He would send HORNETS before them.<br>
                        After all that He did to the Egyptians this should have been easy.<br>
                        But no — they asked Moses to send spies out to search out the land, then bring them a report if
                        they could take the land that was flowing with milk and honey (Num. 13).<br>
                        Moses rehearses their blunder of the faithless Israelites and why they did not enter the
                        promised land (Deu. 1:19-40).<br><br>

                        Why is faith so important to believers?<br>
                        Because without it, it is impossible to please God (Heb. 11:6).<br>
                        As Christians let us not forget how and what our Lord has brought us through and the miracles
                        that we are in Him and by Him.<br>
                        For the just shall live by faith. Hab. 2:4; Ro. 1:17; Ga. 3:11; He. 10:38.

            <h2>"THE MILLENNIUM REIGN OF CHRIST"</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="short-text">

                    As Christians we understand from the scriptures that millennium
                    refers to a 1,000 - year period. It can also be used to describe any 1,000 - year span. The word
                    "millennium" isn't explicitly mentioned in the bible. However, Revelation 20:1-7 describes a 1,000-
                    year period, often interpreted as the Millennium of Christ. This passage forms the basis for the
                    millennium theology. Let's look at the three views of the millennium which are :

                </span>
                <span class="full-text" style="display: none;">
                    1. POSTMILLENNIALISM, which believes Christ will return after a long period of gospel growth and
                    earthly prosperity. The church's efforts will lead to a "golden age" with widespread Christian
                    influence and moral transformation, ultimately culminating in Christ's return. This view in my
                    understanding is extremely out of context with Israel's prophecy and promises.<br><br>

                    2. AMILLENNIALISM sees the 1,000 years as symbolic, not literal, and that Christ's reign is NOW
                    through the church. They focus on the spiritual kingdom, not a future earthly reign. This view
                    emphasizes the present reality of God's kingdom. AGAIN, ignoring ISRAEL'S PROMISES AND
                    PROPHECIES.<br><br>

                    3. PREMILLENNIALISM (which I believe and teach, will explain why in my discourse) believes in Jesus’
                    return before the 1,000-year reign. The rapture or the CAPTIONING AWAY removes believers, followed
                    by the tribulation. Then, Christ returns to defeat evil and establishes a literal earthly millennial
                    kingdom, with believers reigning with Him.<br><br>

                    This is what I believe to be the true hermeneutics and exegesis concerning eschatology of Israel and
                    the body of Christ.<br><br>

                    These are some of many prophecies concerning the thousand-year reign of Christ:<br>
                    Psalms 2:7-9 — Christ rules with a rod of iron.<br>
                    Isaiah 11:6-11 — Peaceful kingdom with the Lord and the saints.<br>
                    Ezekiel 37:21-28 — God's people gathered, Davidic kingdom restored.<br>
                    Zechariah 14:9 — God's kingdom on earth, King of Kings, the reign of Christ.<br>
                    Revelation 20:1-6 — Satan bound for a thousand years.<br><br>

                    Now the question is, will there be sin within the hearts of men and women during Christ's reign? And
                    the answer is YES, according to the scriptures:<br>
                    Isaiah 2:2-4; 11:3-5; 65:20<br>
                    Zechariah 14:16-21<br><br>

                    At the end of the 1,000-year reign of Christ, Satan will be loosed for a season. Then Satan will
                    carry on his rebellion and deception to those on the earth who still have the nature of our first
                    parents, Adam and Eve — which will be many: "the number of whom is as the sand of the sea" (Rev.
                    20:8).<br><br>

                    This has been a brief understanding of the MILLENNIUM REIGN OF CHRIST.<br>
                    Hope to see you there, and as always keep brother Kithcart and his family in your prayers, and may
                    the grace of our God be with you, amen.
